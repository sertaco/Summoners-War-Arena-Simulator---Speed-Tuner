# Summoners-War-Arena-Simulator---Speed-Tuner
Summoners War is an awesome unit-battle, resource management, RPG mobile game that I have been playing since April 2015. The game is comprised of PvP as well as PvE content. For the early game, all it matters is PvE content but as you come to the end game PvP becomes more relevant. And for PvE content, speed tuning your units is important. I started this as I needed a speed tuner for my Arena team but could not find one for my purposes. So I decided to write my own. This simulator is based on the detailed theory you can find on https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerswar/comments/3vtfgk/indepth_guide_speedtuning_your_arena_team/ (Credits to reddit/iPodbiak) I plan to make an HTML interface and put this on my website but for the timebeing I will just put this on Github.
